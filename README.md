## Overview

This is a simple, clean profile card built using HTML and CSS. It features a circular image, a name heading, a short about section, a hobbies list, and a styled button linking to my GitHub.

### What I learned

- Styling elements using CSS custom properties and HSL for vibrant, consistent colors
- Applying visual hierarchy with font sizes and styles
- How to link a button to an external page while maintaining styling
